# exowomb
Artificial womb simulation UI for fetal development in space microgravity — built with Python, Plotly Dash, and scientific visualization tools.
# 🌌 ExoWomb
<br>
**ExoWomb** is a space-compatible artificial womb simulation dashboard — built using **Python**, **Plotly Dash**, and scientific visualization tools.  
It is designed to explore **fetal development in microgravity**, with real-time UI controls and potential deformity correction via pressure simulation.

<br>
## 🌱 Origin of the Idea
<br>
While watching a Discovery Science program on **NASA + SpaceX's Dragon capsule**, I had a strange but powerful thought:  
<br>
> "What if humans gave birth in space?"  
<br>
Would the baby develop normal physiology in zero gravity?  
<br>
Would the absence of corrective pressure inside the womb lead to structural deformities?
<br>
This idea led to **ExoWomb** — a simulator for fetal growth in space-like conditions, allowing parameter control and real-time data visualization.

## 🧠 What This Project Does
<br>
- 🧪 Simulates fetal development under microgravity conditions  
<br>
- ⚙️ Provides control sliders for external pressure, fluid dynamics, and nutrient levels  
<br>
- 📈 Visualizes parameters like heart rate, bone growth, fluid pressure using **matplotlib**  
<br>
- 🧬 Conceptual model for **space medicine**, **astrobiology**, and **medical UI design**  
<br>
- ☁️ To be hosted via **Google Cloud ($300 free credits)**

<br>
## 🎯 Project Goals
<br>
- Build a **Plotly Dash** based interactive UI
<br>
- Model an artificial womb with user-controlled fetal environment
<br>
- Integrate visualization and logic modules using **Python** and **BioPython**
<br>
- Create a responsive, clean, Figma-inspired dashboard
<br>
- Open-source the project for beginner-friendly contributions
<br>
- Submit this idea as part of **Google Summer of Code 2025** under relevant open science orgs

## 🤝 GSoC 2026 Plans
<br>
> I’m preparing **ExoWomb** as a personal proposal for **Google Summer of Code 2025**, aiming to apply under:
<br>
> - OpenLifeSci  
<br>
> - NumFOCUS  
<br>
> - NASA OpenMCT (if accepted)
<br>
I plan to contribute as a **UI/UX Designer + beginner Python developer**, building a fetal simulation interface tailored for space health and open science research.
